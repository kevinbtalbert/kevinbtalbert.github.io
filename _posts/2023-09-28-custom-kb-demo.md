*This video demonstrates how Cloudera DataFlow (CDF), Cloudera Machine Learning (CML), and OpenAI can be leveraged to build a custom knowledge base that an enterprise can use for enabling individuals to access their own Custom Q and A chatbot. Using CDF, we deploy a Nifi template that accepts a websiteâ€™s sitemap as parameter of a POST request made from Postman, and outputs the important html content of every page from the website. CML utilizes OpenAI's API to semantic search with the gathered documents and outputs a result based on content from the custom knowledge base.*
